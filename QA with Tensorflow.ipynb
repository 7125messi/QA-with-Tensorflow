    "# Question Answering with TensorFlow\n",
    "## Using advanced neural networks to take on challenging natural language tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### By Steven Hewitt\n",
    "\n",
    "A question answering, or QA, system is a system designed to answer questions posed in natural language. Some QA systems draw information from a source such as a text or an image in order to answer a specific question.  These \"sourced\" systems can be partitioned into two major subcategories: open-domain, in which the questions can be virtually anything but aren't focused on  specific material, and closed-domain, in which the questions have concrete limitations in that they relate to some predefined source (e.g. a provided context, or a specific field like medicine). \n",
    "\n",
    "This article will guide you through the challenging task of creating and coding a neural network-based closed-domain sourced question answering system using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).  In order to do this, we'll use a simplified version of a model known as a Dynamic Memory Network, introduced by Kumar et al in their paper [\"Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing.\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07285)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before we get started\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to installing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) version 1.2, make sure that you’ve installed each of the following:\n",
    "- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org)\n",
    "- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, you can install TQDM to view training progess and get training speed metrics, but it's not required. The code and Jupyter notebook for this article is on GitHub, and I encourage you to grab it and follow along. If this is your first time working with TensorFlow, I recommend that you first check out Aaron Schumacher's [\"Hello, TensorFlow\"](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/hello-tensorflow) for a quick overview of what Tensorflow is and how it works.  If this is your first time using TensorFlow for natural language tasks, I would also encourage you to check out [\"Textual Entailment with TensorFlow\"](#link not live yet), since it introduces several concepts that will be used to help construct this network.\n",

    "### Exploring bAbI\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we will be using the bAbI dataset created by Facebook. This dataset, like all QA datasets, contains questions.  Questions in bAbI are very straightforward, although some are trickier than others. All of the questions in this dataset have an associated \"context,\" which is a sequence of sentences guaranteed to have the details necessary to answer the question. In addition, the dataset provides the correct answer to each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "bAbI's questions are partitioned into twenty different tasks based off what skills are required to answer the question, each of which has its own set of questions for training and a separate set for testing. These tasks test a variety of standard natural language processing abilities, including time reasoning (task #14) and inductive logic (task #16).  To get a better idea of this, let's consider a concrete example of a question that our QA system will be expected to answer, as shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"questionex.png\">\n",
    "<center><em>Figure 1.</em> An example of bAbI's data, with the context in blue, question in gold, and answer in green.  Credit: Steven Hewitt.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This task (#5) tests the network's understanding of actions where there are relationships between three objects.  Grammatically speaking, it tests to see if the system can distinguish between the subject, direct object, and indirect object.  In this case, the question asks for the indirect object in the last sentence - the person who received the milk from Jeff.  The network must make the distinction between the fifth sentence, in which Bill was the subject and Jeff was the indirect object, and the sixth sentence in which Jeff was the subject.  Of course, our network doesn't receive any explicit training on what a subject or object is, and has to extrapolate this understanding from the examples in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another minor problem the system must solve is understanding the various synonyms used throughout the dataset. Jeff \"handed\" the milk to Bill, but he could have just as easily \"gave\" it or \"passed\" it to him.  In this regard, though, the network doesn't have to start from scratch.  It gets some assistance in the form of word vectorization, which can store infomation about the definition of words and their relations to other words.  Similar words have similar vectorizations, which means that the network can treat them as nearly the same word. For word vectorization, we'll use Stanford’s Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), which I’ve discussed previously in more detail [here](link to previous article).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the tasks have a restriction that forces the context to contain the exact word used for the answer. In our example, the answer \"Bill\" can be found in the context.  We will use this restriction to our advantage, as we can search the context for the word closest in meaning to our final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might take a few minutes to download and unpack all of this data, so run the next four code snippets to get that started as quickly as possible.  It'll download bAbI and GloVe and unpack the necessary files from those datasets so they can be used in our network. "

    "### Parsing GloVe and handling unknown tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've read [my previous article](link to previous article), you may remember `sentence2sequence`, a function that would turn a string into a matrix based on the mapping defined by GloVe. It split up the string into *tokens*, smaller strings that are roughly equivalent to punctuation, words, or parts of words.  In \"Bill traveled to the kitchen.\", there are six tokens: five that correspond to each of the words, and the last for the period at the end.  Each token gets individually vectorized, resulting in a list of vectors corresponding to each sentence as shown below in Figure 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"vectorize.png\">\n",
    "<center><em>Figure 2.</em> The process of turning a sentence into vectors. Credit: Steven Hewitt.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In some tasks in bAbI, the system will encounter words that are not in the GloVe word vectorization. In order for the network to be capable of processing these unknown words, we need to maintain a consistent vectorization of those words. Common practice is to replace all unknown tokens with a single `<UNK>` vector, but this isn't always effective.  My technique is to instead use randomization to draw a new vectorization for each unique unknown token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3’s `functools.lru_cache` helps us gain consistent representations by returning a cached result for every repeated unknown token, and in Python 2 we can seed the random state with a hash of the unknown string.  The first time we run across a new unknown token, we simply draw a new vectorization from the (Gaussian-approximated) distribution of the original GloVe vectorizations.  To gather the distribution hyperparameters, Numpy has functions that automatically calculate variance and mean.\n",

Questions and answers are on the same line, separated by tabs, so we can use tabs as a marker of whether a specific line refers to a question or not.  When the numbering resets, future questions will refer to the new context (note that often there is more than one question corresponding to a single context).

The structure of this network is split loosely into four modules, and is described first by Ankit Kumar et al. in his article titled \"Ask Me Anything: Dynamic Memory Networks for Natural Language Processing.\" The network is designed around having a recurrent layer's memory be set dynamically based off of other information in the text, hence the name Dynamic Memory Network (or DMN for short).\n",

The person gets a chance, first of all, to read the context and create memories of the facts inside.   With those facts in mind, they then read the question, and re-examine the context specifically searching for the answer to that question, comparing the question to each of the facts.  Sometimes, one fact guides us to another.  In the bAbI dataset, the network might want to find where a football is.  It might search for sentences about the football to find that John was the last person to touch the football, then search for sentences about John to find that John had been at both the bedroom and the hallway.  Once it realizes that John had been last at the hallway, it can then answer the question and confidently say that the football is in the hallway.\n",

    "#### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The input module is the first of the four modules that a Dynamic Memory Network uses to come up with its answer, and consists of a simple pass over the input with a Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, (TensorFlow's [tf.contrib.nn.GRUCell](docs)) to gather pieces of evidence.  Each  piece of evidence, or *fact*, corresponds to a single sentence in the context, and is represented by the output at that timestep.  This requires a bit of non-TensorFlow preprocessing so that we can gather the locations of the ends of sentences and pass that in to TensorFlow for use in later modules.  We'll take care of that external processing later on, when we get to training.  We can use that processed data with TensorFlow's `gather_nd` to select the corresponding outputs.  The function `gather_nd` is an extraordinarily useful tool, and I'd suggest you look up the API documentation for it [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/gather_nd) to learn how it works."

    "#### Episodic Memory\n",
    "Our third module, the episodic memory module, is where things begin to get interesting.  It uses attention to do multiple passes, each pass consisting of GRUs iterating over the input.  Each iteration inside each pass has a weighted update on current memory, based off of how much attention is being paid to the corresponding fact at that time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Attention!\n",
    "  Attention in neural networks was originally designed for image analysis, especially for cases where parts of the image are far more relevant than others.  Networks use attention to determine the best locations in which to do further analysis when performing tasks such as finding locations of objects in images, tracking objects that move between images, facial recognition, or other tasks that benefit from finding the most pertinent information for the task within the image.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The main problem is that attention, or at least hard attention (which attends to exactly one input location) is not easily optimizable.  As with most other neural networks, our optimization scheme is to compute the derivative of a loss function with respect to our inputs and weights, and hard attention is simply not differentiable thanks to its binary nature.  Instead, we are forced to use the real-valued version known as soft attention, which combines all the input locations that could be attended to using some form of weighting.  The weighting is, thankfully, fully differentiable and can be trained normally.  While it is possible to learn hard attention, it’s much more difficult and sometimes performs worse than soft attention.  Thus, we’ll stick with soft attention for this model.  Don't worry about coding the derivative; TensorFlow's optimization schemes do it for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate attention in this model by constructing similarity measures between each fact, our current memory, and the original question. (Note that this is different from normal attention, which only constructs similarity measures between facts and current memory.) We pass the results through a two-layer feed-forward network to get an attention constant for each fact.  We then modify the memory by doing a weighted pass with a GRU over the input facts (weighted by the corresponding attention constant).  In order to avoid adding incorrect information into memory when the context is shorter than the full length of the matrix, we create a mask for which facts exist and don't attend at all (i.e. retain the same memory) when the fact does not exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another notable aspect is that the attention mask is nearly always wrapped around a representation used by a layer.  For images, that wrapping is most likely to happen around a convolutional layer (most likely one with a direct mapping to locations in the image), and for natural language that wrapping is most likely to happen around a recurrent layer. Wrapping attention around a feed-forward layer, while technically possible, is usually not useful – at least not in a way that can’t be more easily simulated by further feed-forward layers.  "

    "### Optimizing Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is the default optimizer for a neural network.  Its goal is to decrease the network's \"loss,\" which is a measure of how poorly the network performs. It does this by finding the derivative of loss with respect to each of the weights under the current input, and then \"descends\" the weights so that they’ll reduce the loss.  Most of the time, this works well enough, but often it’s not ideal.  There are various schemes that use “momentum” or other approximations of the more direct path to the optimal weights.  One of the most useful of these optimization schemes is known as Adaptive Moment Estimation, or Adam.    Adam estimates the first two moments of the gradient by calculating an exponentially decaying average of past iterations' gradients and squared gradients, which correspond to the estimated mean and the estimated variance of these gradients.  The calculations use, therefore, two additional hyperparameters for how quickly the averages decay with the addition of new information.  The averages are initialized as zero, which leads to bias towards zero, especially when those hyperparameters near one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to counteract that bias, Adam computes bias-corrected moment estimates that are greater in magnitude than the originals.  The corrected estimates are then used to update the weights throughout the network.  The combination of these estimates make Adam one of the best choices overall for optimization, especially for complex networks.  This applies doubly to data which is very sparse, such as is common in natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, we can use Adam by creating a `tf.train.AdamOptimizer`."

We do this with a validation set, which is taken from testing data so that it has no overlap with the training data. Using a validation set based on testing data allows us to get a better sense of how well the network can generalize what it learns and apply it to other contexts.  If we validate on the training data, the network may *overfit* - in other words, learn specific examples and memorize the answers to them, which doesn't help the network answer new questions.\n",

    "If you installed TQDM, you can use it to keep track of how long the network has been training, and receive an estimate of when training will finish.  You can stop the training at any time if you feel the results are good enough, by interrupting the Jupyter Notebook kernel."

    "After a little bit of training, let's peek inside and see what kinds of answers we're getting from the network!  In the diagrams below, we visualize attention over each of the episodes (rows) for all the sentences (columns) in our context; darker colors represent more attention paid to that sentence on that episode.  You should see attention change between at least two episodes for each question, but sometimes attention will be able to find the answer within one, and sometimes it will take all four episodes.  If the attention appears to be blank, it may be saturating and paying attention to everything at once.  In that case, you can try training with a higher `weight_decay` in order to discourage that from happening.  Later on in training, saturation becomes extremely common."

In order to get good results, you may have to train for a long period of time (on my home desktop, it took about 12 hours), but you should eventually be able to reach very high accuracies (over 90%). Experienced users of Jupyter Notebook should note that at any time, you can interrupt training and still save the progress the network has made so far; this is useful if you want to visualize the attention and answers the network is currently giving."

    "- *Other tasks in bAbI.*  We've only sampled the many tasks that bAbI has to offer. Try changing the preprocessing to fit another task and see how our dynamic memory network performs on it!  You may want to retrain the network before you try running it on the new task, of course.  If the task doesn't guarantee that the answer is inside the context, you may want to compare output to a dictionary of words and their corresponding vectors instead.  (Those tasks are 6-10 and 17-20.)  I personally recommend trying task 1 or 3, which you can do by changing the values of `test_set_file` and `train_set_file`.\n",

    "- *Supervised training.*  Our attention mechanism is *unsupervised*, in that we don't specify explicitly which sentences should be attended to and instead let the network figure that out on its own.  Try adding loss to the network that encourages the attention mechanism towards attending to the right sentences.\n",

    "- *Coattention.*  Instead of attending simply over the input sentences, some researchers have found success in what they call [\"Dynamic Coattention Networks\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01604.pdf), which attends over a matrix representing two locations in two sequences simultaneously.\n",
